# VirtualPetsAmok
Welcome to our app, VirtualPetsAmok!!

How to play:
- Run the program. You will see a greeting followed by a menu with numbers 1 to 7.
- **Make sure you press 1 and hit enter before you do anything else.** You need to create a pet before you can interact with your pet using the other numbers.
  - Selecting 1 will ask you for a pet name, then for the type of pet you would like to add to the shelter. You can name your pet any name you want, and you can specify any species of pet. There are no restrictions.
- Selecting 2 will display the name and species of your pets. *note: when we add lists we will have functionality to play with different pets in the list*
- Selecting 3 will display the status of your pets' health level, boredom level, and hunger level. The numbers displayed are on a scale from 0 to 10. A health level of 10 means your pet is perfectly healthy, a boredom level of 10 means your pet is extremely bored, and a hunger level of 10 means your pet is extremely hungry. You can modify these values from the main menu using numbers 4, 5, and 6.
  - Selecting 4 will give you the option to either feed your current pet or all of your pets. Feeding reduces hunger level to 0. *note: hunger will increase over time with later iterations*
  - Selecting 5 will give you the option to either take your current pet or all of your pets to the doctor, where their health level will increase to 10.
  - Selecting 6 will let you play with either your current pet or all of your pets, which will reduce boredom by 2, increase health by 1, and increase hunger by 2.
- Selecting 7 will exit the game.
